To create a new pricelist in the system, click **Add** and complete all the required fields: 

**Number** - enter the number manually or configure the [**numerator**](Numerators.md).

**Valid from** \_\_\_\_\_\_ **to** \_\_\_\_\_\_ - set the validity period of the pricelist. The effective date is automatically set to the date and time when the pricelist iscreated. You can change it if necessary. If the closing date is not set, the pricelist will be valid until a new one for the listed items of the vendor becomes effective.  

**Vendor** - сlick in the field and select the vendor from the list of  [**partners**](Partners_directory.md). 

**Note** - if there areaspects of dealing with this price list, specify them in this field and they will be visible in the general list of pricelists.  

The next step is to enter a list of items on the **Lines** tab. You can use the **Add** button and enter one item at a time, but price lists usually contain a large number of items, so it's easier to use the **Search** tab and enter a list of  items.

Go to the **Search** tab. The right block displays all items from the **Category** selected in the left block. All items for which you specify **Price** will be automatically displayed on the **Lines **tab.

The item **Code** and **Barcode** columns are filled in automatically if specified in the item card. It often happens that the vendor's item name does not match the names in your merchandise accounting system. It is therefore may be useful to fill in the **Vendor name** and/or **Vendor reference** columns. This avoids confusion and misunderstandings.
