The next step is to enter a list of items on the **Lines** tab. You can use the **Add** button and enter one item at a time, but price lists usually contain a large number of items, so it's easier to use the **Search** tab and enter a list of items.

Go to the **Search** tab. The right block displays all items from the **Category** selected in the left block. All items for which you specify **Price** will be automatically displayed on the **Lines** tab.

The item **Code** and **Barcode** columns are filled in automatically if specified in the item card. It often happens that the vendor's item name does not match the names in your merchandise accounting system. It is therefore may be useful to fill in the **Vendor name** and/or **Vendor reference** columns. This avoids confusion and misunderstandings.
